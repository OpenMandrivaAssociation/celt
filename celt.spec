%description
The CELT codec is an experimental audio codec for use in low-delay
speech and audio communication.

CELT stands for "Constrained Energy Lapped Transform". It applies some
of the CELP principles, but does everything in the frequency domain,
which removes some of the limitations of CELP. CELT is suitable for
both speech and music and currently features:

* Ultra-low latency (typically from 3 to 9 ms)
* Full audio bandwidth (44.1 kHz and 48 kHz)
* Support for both voice and music
* Stereo support
* Packet loss concealment
* Constant bit-rates from 32 kbps to 128 kbps and above
* A fixed-point version of the encoder and decoder

The CELT codec is meant to close the gap between Vorbis and Speex for
applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired.
